On the top layer the small condansators work fine. So as the regulators.
It seems that at the bottom Layer the PCB just burnt due to wrong using
or poor designing i guess. The parts in the area thats burnt does not
work. And also some of the Mosfets seems to short.
--------------------------
Working Parts
- 35volt 1000 Micro farad capacitors.
- 2 mosfets that are in the right
- inductor
- Transformator
--------------------------
Broken Parts

- 400V 150 micro Farad capacitors
- Bridge Rectifier
- Small Bypass capacitors
- Resistors

I salvaged the 35 Volt capacitors.
